# Question
Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer
The Spread Operator is used to 'spread' an iterable into its elements, while the Rest Operator 'collects' multiple elements into an array. The Rest Operator is handy in destructuring to extract the remaining properties.

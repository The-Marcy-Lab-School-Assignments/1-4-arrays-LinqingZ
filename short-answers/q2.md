# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer
No. `addBostonToFavorites` is not a pure function because the `favoriteLocations` changed after called the function. 
You can muate the const varible but cannot reassign to another value after the const.
